# feedclass

feedclass is an advanced RSS aggregator developed entirely in Python. It efficiently fetches and parses multiple RSS feeds while incorporating intelligent natural language processing (NLP) features such as content summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and automated content curation.

## Overview

The architecture of feedclass can be deployed as either a monolithic application or as microservices. The core components include:

- **RssFeed**: Manages individual RSS feeds, handling metadata, entries, and NLP processing.
- **RssFeedManager**: Oversees multiple RssFeed instances, orchestrating feed fetching, caching, and NLP tasks.
- **Redis**: Used for caching feed data to improve efficiency.
- **Elasticsearch**: Provides advanced search capabilities through semantic and fuzzy matching.
- **Kafka**: Facilitates event-driven communication between microservices.

The project structure is organized as follows:

## Features

- Fetch and parse multiple RSS feeds.
- Cache feed data in Redis for improved performance.
- Perform intelligent NLP tasks such as:
  - Summarization of feed entries.
  - Named entity recognition (NER).
  - Sentiment and emotion analysis.
  - Translation of feed summaries.
- Automated content curation with smart throttling and auto-categorization.
- Support for semantic search and fuzzy matching via Elasticsearch.
- Microservices architecture with event-driven pipelines using Kafka.

## Getting started

### Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following technologies installed on your computer:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Redis (for caching)
- Elasticsearch (for search functionality)
- Kafka (for event streaming)
- Required Python packages:
  - feedparser
  - requests
  - nltk
  - transformers
  - elasticsearch
  - redis
  - kafka-python
  - pandas

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the Redis server and Elasticsearch instance.
4. Start Kafka and create the necessary topics.
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
