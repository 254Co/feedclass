# feedclass

feedclass is an advanced RSS aggregator developed entirely in Python. It efficiently fetches and parses multiple RSS feeds while integrating intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for tasks such as content summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and automated content curation.

## Overview

The architecture of feedclass is designed to support both monolithic and microservices deployments. It consists of two primary classes: `RssFeed`, which manages individual RSS feeds, and `RssFeedManager`, which orchestrates multiple `RssFeed` instances. The system leverages a microservices architecture with event-driven pipelines, allowing for seamless integration with external services like Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for semantic search, and Kafka for distributed event streaming.

The project structure includes a modular design that separates concerns across different components, making it easier to maintain and extend. Key technologies used in this project include:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching.
- **Elasticsearch**: Search engine based on the Lucene library.
- **Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform.
- **feedparser**: Library for parsing RSS feeds.
- **requests**: Library for making HTTP requests.
- **nltk**: Natural Language Toolkit for NLP tasks.
- **transformers**: Library for state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **pyspark**: Framework for distributed data processing.

## Features

- Fetch and parse multiple RSS feeds efficiently.
- Cache feed data and perform delta parsing to identify changes.
- Apply intelligent NLP techniques including summaries, topic modeling, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment/emotion analysis.
- Provide translation and multi-lingual support.
- Enable automated content curation with smart throttling and auto-categorization.
- Support a microservices architecture with event-driven pipelines.
- Perform semantic search and fuzzy matching using Elasticsearch or vector embeddings.
- Implement active learning and human-in-the-loop processes for iterative model refinement.

## Getting started

### Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Redis (local or cloud version)
- Elasticsearch (local or cloud version)
- Kafka (local or cloud version)
- Required Python packages: `feedparser`, `requests`, `nltk`, `transformers`, `elasticsearch`, `redis`, `kafka-python`, `pandas`, `pyspark`

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd feedclass
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start your Redis, Elasticsearch, and Kafka services.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

5. You can add RSS feeds using the `RssFeedManager` and process them using the provided functionalities.
